![1984-cover](/assets/images/1984.jpg){: .align-left}1984 by George Orwell is a classic literature that depicts a world where the government is constantly in control of people’s lives and are in constant monitor for any traitorous thoughts and actions. This is a very depressing book and I might even add that if your personal life is not going that great at the moment, please refrain from reading this book altogether! That is not a joke. 1984 is as dark as it can get and I have personally never read anything quite like it. However, I promise you that this book will get you thinking a lot not only about our present times but also what could happen in the far away future. This gem of a story is truly frightening in a way that I have never felt before either for a book read or movie watched. If you are tired of the usual horror flicks that employ the same scare tactics over and over again in hopes of making you jump out of your seat, then I dare you to read 1984 to experience a different kind of horror that affects a deeper part of your mind! I promise you that 1984 will leave a big impression in your lives well after you having finished with it.

In 1984, we step into the shoes of Winston Smith. Winston is like any other person living in a country where  the Party is constantly watching your every move through telescreens and microphones. To survive in this new era, total submission to the Party’s ways is an absolute must. Think and act any differently and you’ll find yourself vaporized without any hint at all that you actually did existed. The problem with George is that his memory keeps him from being a total submissive person in this totalitarian government. As a reader, you’re bound to have questions such as how did this government come to be? Were things always this way? Is life better now than it was decades ago? Well, please step inside the mind of Winston where even thinking of these questions are bound to get you vaporized if you aren’t careful in controlling your emotions. If you’ve heard of the phrase that Big Brother is Watching You! at some point or another pointing to conspiracies about the government monitoring your every move be it cell phone conversations or Internet access, then be glad that you picked up 1984 because that is where the idea most likely originated from!

1984 starts off very slow and the author repeats many things throughout but once you start hitting that halfway point, get ready for a literal mind takeover from the author. I kept saying earlier that this book is horrifying in a special kind of way and if you actually picture yourself in Winston’s position and picture in your head the things that he sees and witnesses, I’m sure you’ll be scared as well. Better yet, picture your own self in Winston’s place. Imagine having to live in a government similar to that of 1984. The beauty of portraying Winston to the readers is that we can all relate to him in one way or another. We like to sometimes think to ourselves that we are somehow “special”. In 1984 however, you’re no different than anyone else because the government tells you so. At first, you’ll likely have a lot of questions and wonder how other humans cope with the whole situation. This is where things get interesting as you learn about the Party and its purpose.

It’s definitely fascinating to learn that George Orwell published 1984 in 1949. Mr. Orwell is definitely who you would consider “ahead of his time” and 1984 proves that. For his story to still have some impact in today’s society is amazing, especially to conspiracists. Can we win against such a government as that depicted here in 1984? What will it take to bring it down? Is it a lost cause? There will be so many questions you will ask yourself after the completion of 1984. That’s a good thing however because 1984 is not meant to be just read once and completely forgotten the next day. This is truly a magnificent piece of work. Just be prepared to have every ounce of positive energy drained from you!
