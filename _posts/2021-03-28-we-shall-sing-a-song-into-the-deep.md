![sing-song-deep-cover](/assets/images/sing-song-deep.jpg){: .align-left}We Shall Sing a Song into the Deep by Andrew Kelly Steward is a short science fiction and post apocalyptic novel. With the entire story taking place within a submarine, it evokes a claustrophobic setting that is sure to please many looking for something dreary and dystopian like. I’ve read this novel being similar and  compared to A Canticle for Leibowitz along with The Hunt for Red October but in my opinion it more resembles the Silo series by Huge Howey. Either way, this was a great read and I believe a first for me from this author.

>“If I am to die, I will go to God the way I was put into the world.” – **Remy**

I thought it was pretty unique how the author decided to bring religious singing into the forefront of this dystopian setting and mind you, all within a submarine. Remy, our main character and lead singer in the group, has a hidden secret that all the other brothers of this strange world is unaware of. Betraying this secret would undoubtedly result in harsh punishment and even death. When she is all of a sudden entrusted with keeping yet another secret from the dying captain of the sub, her life is in even more danger. Why was she rescued and kept alive in this submarine to live with all the other boys? What is really happening in the world above and why exactly are they bidding their time to unleash a cruise missile upon the world in an event they term The Last Judgement? Why is all of their fate tied to this event?

Anyone looking to take on a short read on one of those stories involving characters being led astray and brainwashed should look into this. The main idea isn’t all that new but the author does do enough to give it a fresh take. Besides, I don’t know about others but I still get goosebumps whenever the reveal is made in these types of stories. It’s like we expect it to happen yet we still get hyped with anticipation when that moment actually arrives. This ultimately leads to me breezing through this short novel within a day. Bravo to this the author. It will be interesting to see if he will continue with this series. Maybe one day he can write another short novel taking place in the same world and timeline but starring the “other side” instead?
