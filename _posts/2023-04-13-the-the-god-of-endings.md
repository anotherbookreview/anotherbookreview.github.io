![god-of-endings-cover](/assets/images/god-of-endings.jpg){: .align-left}The God of Endings by Jacqueline Holland is one of the most beautiful yet sad novel I've had the pleasure of reading since I can remember. The thought of being able to live forever sounds like bliss for so many yet here we can to hear from a seemingly normal individual who had no choice in the matter whatsoever and highlights how that's not necessarily always true. It's a great concept and one that works exceptionally well given how our somber our female lead can be. Yes, The God of Endings is a slow burn of a read and if you're expecting a lot of fangs, gore and blood sucking throughout, you'll do well to move on. 

>Justice was a private matter that you didn't expect anyone to execute for you. You did it yourself, or it didn't get done. - **Anna**

We follow Anna from her early childhood and through centuries afterward. The chapters alternate between her past and her present life. Each little mini story of Anna's past allows the readers to more understand how she came to so despise her gift. Try as she may, things just seem to never work out for Anna. Certain traumas within her past always catches to her. She tries to love but knows that everyone she loves will wilt away and be taken from her eventually. So, she lives her life as a recluse and is always on guard and wary of change. The chapters dealing with the present as an art teacher to little children gives her an enormous amount of joy, but The God of Endings is always nearing closer and closer. 

>"I'm sorry. I'm so very sorry." And I mean it more than they can know. - **Anna**

There is little in the way of romance, so folks looking for that will be disappointed. Instead, we get another type of love. Anna, who has turned into something inhuman and has witnessed and experienced so many of the tragedies and evilness of mankind throughout the centuries, is still one of the most caring and understanding person in a room full of humans. It is this naivety, if you can call it that, is what makes reading about Anna so special. It can obviously be a bit dry at times, especially during the chapters dealing with her present life in her schooling with the children, but I never stopped wanting to see how things would end up for Anna. 

>Why did all these people wish so earnestly to live? If they had any sense, they'd stop running; they'd turn and face death and be done with it. - **Anna**

The God of Endings is a really great vampire novel and should deserve a read for any fans of the undead. What we have here obviously isn't an original idea or theme when it comes to vampires and being able to live forever, but I felt it was greatly written nonetheless.
