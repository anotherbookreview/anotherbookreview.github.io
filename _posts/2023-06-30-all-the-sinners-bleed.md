![all-the-sinners-bleed-cover](/assets/images/all-the-sinners-bleed.jpg){: .align-left}All the Sinners Bleed by S.A. Crosby is an amazing mystery thriller. It seems like it's the season for crime and mystery novels because I've gotten more recommendations in my inbox than I can remember. Fortunately, I backed the right one. Everything from the pacing to the characters, events, and dialogue was done very efficiently. There weren't too many dull moments, as the break between the main character going off duty as a sheriff and returning back to his job is very quick. 

>Waiting for the world to shed tears for your pain was like waiting for a statue to speak. - **Titus Crown**

Following Titus Crown, the small town of Charon gets one of its first elected African American sheriffs. In a town steeped in the bloody southern history of slavery and the Civil War, it was nothing short of a miracle that Titus got the actual votes he needed to win and that someone of color actually wanted the job. The one disappointment that sparked some irritation in me was the lack of imagination in using yet another clichÃ© crime when it comes to young children and sick and deranged adults. Can we please move on from this tired topic? Yes, it is disgusting. Yes, it makes the villains horrible people and makes it near impossible for the readers to feel any sort of passion for them. Yes, the victims deserve justice, etc. I sincerely hope that a more vivid imagination can lead great authors to come up with something that hasn't been tried and done a thousand times in crime novels.

Regardless of that, All the Sinners Bleed is just begging to be adapted either on the big screen or as a miniseries on television.
