![wind-through-keyhole-cover](/assets/images/wind-through-keyhole.jpg){: .align-left}The Wind Through the Keyhole can be considered a stand-alone novel/story in the Dark Tower series by Stephen King. I believe this was published after the series ended and as a person who likes to read a series chronologically, it was the next in line. I admit that I have forsaken the Dark Tower series for a while now because I didn’t like how the story was progressing. But I decided to give it another shot and continue on with this one. Well, that was a bad mistake. Sort of.

Do you like fairy tales? Because that’s exactly what you’ll be getting with this novel. I usually don’t read excerpts or reviews of any book in a series prior to starting it. I just find out which book is next on the list and read away. Therefore, it came as a big surprise to me as to how this story was played out. I was a bit excited in the beginning when we got to follow Roland and his band around but once they had found shelter, the real story began.

It’s not that I don’t appreciate what King is trying to do here but to be honest, it’s just not up my alley. Had I known what I was getting myself into, I think I would have skipped this book altogether. If I remember correctly, there was only a part or two that really contributed to the actual Dark Tower series in itself and that includes Roland and his mother. You could technically skip this book and read that bit of information online somewhere. Although Roland does tell a story of an accident that happened when he was in his younger days, that in itself also wasn’t that satisfactory in my opinion. It was okay.

Suffice it to say, I think I wouldn’t have been that disappointed if the pages were just cut short in half. It was just too long for it being a fairy tale and with King’s story telling prowess, I’m sure he would have accomplished the same results.
