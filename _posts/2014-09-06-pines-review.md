![pines-cover](/assets/images/pines.jpg){: .align-left}Pines by Blake Crouch is the first book in the Wayward Pines trilogy set. The book seemed interesting at first glance and it will be made into an episodic TV show. Something must be good about it right? Unfortunately, I belong to that small group of readers that did not find a whole lot of enjoyment after having read through it. A lot of things just felt off and worst of all, the theme here is so cliche that veteran readers must have sniffed out the ending way before it came. The pacing was a bit slow and I found myself in “fast reading” mode after about 1/2 – 3/4 of the way in. The best way I can sum everything up after having finished with Pines is that this book/story can be considered a good one if, in my honest opinion, you are just beginning in your book reading adventures. As a veteran reader though, I just felt that there wasn’t really anything here to captivate my attention.

We follow in the foot steps of Ethan Burke, a secret service agent who woke up and found himself in Wayward Pines. He has no idea how he got there, has no way to communicate with the outside world and worst of all, people in town just seem to react to him differently. Is he going insane or is there a deeper mystery here? Does this theme sound familiar to you? I’m guessing it does.

Pacing wise, it can get a bit tedious after a while. Although there were many chase scenes, I just can’t help but wonder if there wasn’t a better way for the author to go about it. They were way too long and grew more tiresome, not more exciting as I think the author would hope to make it. It really does sound like I’m nitpicking and you’d probably be right. But if you read a lot of books like I do, you’d also come to realize what is happening here and see the many flaws of Pines.

Like I mentioned in the beginning though, not all is bad. I’m sure there are many readers who will be surprised and shocked about the ending. Me personally, I’d wouldn’t recommend this series to veteran readers. I’ll definitely much rather watch the TV show instead. It’s just a shame that I’ve read much more interesting books with more original ideas than Pines and they’ll never make it to the big screen. Obviously I can’t say how books two and three will go. It could be that Pines was just the introduction that the author needed to get out of the way to make room for the next two books, which might really kick things off.
