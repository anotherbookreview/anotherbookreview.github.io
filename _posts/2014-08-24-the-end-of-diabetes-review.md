![end-diabetes-cover](/assets/images/end-diabetes.jpg){: .align-left}The End of Diabetes by Joel Fuhrman is a book about reversing diabetes for people who have it along with information on how to prevent it for those who don’t. Although I myself don’t have diabetes, my parents however are a different story. In truth, I was overweight once. Being how I always hovered around the 120-125lb mark all throughout high school, I noticed a slight increase during my college years and an explosive growth after that. At my peak, I was probably around 185-190lb. I finally decided to lose the weight and succeeded in doing it. Now I’m at a steady 135. However, at that time, I wasn’t that interested in diabetes nor ever had it occurred to me that I could have been a victim. Now that I have actually lost the weight, I somehow find myself wanting to learn more about this plague of a disease that is destroying so many lives and to hopefully educate others about it. So, I search on Amazon, found The End of Diabetes by Dr. Joel Fuhrman and the rest was history.

I’m going to save you a lot of time and reading by saying this here: if you are a diabetic and are finally finding yourself not wanting to rely on pills to control this disease anymore, then what you need to do is lose the weight and ultimately, become as near a vegan as you can. If you want to actually know the how’s and why’s, then read this book to find out. Many reading this will balk at having to give up all those good tasting food we are consuming right now but the reason why you are a diabetic is due to those very food you put into your body! I told myself prior to reading this book that if the author tries to somewhat even promote a product of his in order for you to reverse diabetes, I was going to stop reading. Fear not as that didn’t happen. Although he does have his own products that you can buy, he only mentions it in a couple of sentences and it didn’t sound like a promotion but rather just as a reference. The key to success in “curing” diabetes according to the doctor is to become a vegan and exercising more often. Sounds too easy and good to be true but he explains it perfectly in this book.

The book I do admit does get repetitive but I then realize what the doctor was trying to accomplish. If you want to reverse diabetes, there’s only a couple of major things you need to do and he constantly reinforces those points throughout the book. He also explains why some of the other popular diet plans can be bad and even downright dangerous for some people. Although I have tried the “counting calories” strategy before, I found that it didn’t really help and the book explains exactly why. It seems pretty common sense after you read it but for those like us who don’t exactly know how our body functions at a deeper level, it may not have occurred to us at the beginning of why so many of these weight losing diets don’t work.

It’s safe to say for myself that I will never be a full vegan. It takes the utmost commitment for someone to do that. What I can say is that I have made a lifestyle change and I’m committed to staying healthy from now on. It’s true what the doctor says in that our body is so used to all the junk food we put in our body over all those years that you will actually feel very weird when you start eating healthy again. But if you stick with it and follow this guide, you will feel much better about yourself in the long run and you’ll never have to worry about taking yet another pill to control something that could have been prevented in the first place!

If you’re still hesitant, I’d suggest you head over to the author’s website and check out the information he has there. I definitely learned a lot of things after reading this book and whenever I now come across someone who wants to lose the weight, I simply tell them to think like a diabetic! Also, I’m pretty sure you’ll never look at a piece of broccoli the same after having read through this book!
